# Invariants

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ  
Freshness target: 30 days

Enforcement: if an invariant conflicts with the plan, **stop** and log the conflict.

## INV-001
Read the workspace files before making strong claims.

## INV-002
Don’t claim causality without a baseline/control.

## INV-003
One variable-class per run/test unless explicitly testing interaction.

## INV-004
Weak signals are triage only; use primary artifacts for root cause.

## INV-005
Diary is for milestones, not stream-of-consciousness.
