# LIMO Advanced Patterns

These patterns emerged from complex, high-stakes domains (Finance, Legal, Divorce) that needed
more structure than the core framework provides. They are **not scaffolded by default** — domains
adopt them when the need becomes clear through real usage.

## Session Handover

**When to use:** A session is ending (context limit, planned handoff, domain migration) and the
successor needs more context than the standard LIMO files provide. Most useful for domains with
complex in-progress reasoning that can't be reconstructed from files alone.

**Guidelines for what a handover should capture:**
- What just happened and why this handover exists
- Critical context from this session that isn't in the files yet (in-progress reasoning, nuanced positions)
- Annotated pointers to LIMO files ("STATUS_SNAPSHOT — focus on section 3, it just changed")
- What's next: immediate priorities + decision tree for future work
- Mistakes this session made, with corrections (prevents successor from repeating)

**The handover is a disposable document** — delete it once the successor has extracted its value
into the standard LIMO files.

### Full Template (adapt sections to domain needs)

```markdown
# Session Handover — [Domain Name]

**Generated by:** Session [N] on [DATE]
**For:** Successor session. Delete this file once processed.

## 1. What Just Happened
[1-3 sentences explaining why this handover exists]

## 2. Current State
**Read these files in this priority order:**
1. `STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md` — [annotation: what's critical]
2. `OPEN_ITEMS.md` — [annotation: which items are hot]
3. `GOALS.md` — [annotation: which milestone is next]
4. `DECISIONS.md` — [annotation: any recent decisions]

## 3. Critical Context from This Session
[Things that can't be reconstructed from files alone]

## 4. Quick Reference Tables
[Domain-specific lookup tables — financial figures, medical values, dates, anything that took effort to derive]

## 5. Domain Intelligence
[Pattern-level knowledge that took multiple sessions to discover]

## 6. Key People Quick Reference
[Name | Role | Key context — one line each]

## 7. What's Next
**Immediate priorities:**
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

**Decision Tree for Future Work:**
1. If [condition] → [recommended action]
2. If [condition] → [recommended action]

## 8. Analytical Breakthroughs
[Insights that took multiple sessions to derive — these should NEVER be re-derived from scratch]

## 9. Mistakes I Made
[Specific errors → corrections. Prevents successor from repeating.]

## 10. Tone Reminder
[How to interact with [USER] in this domain]
```

## Cross-Domain Boot Prompt

**When to use:** One domain session needs to spawn a sibling domain session and wants to pass
accumulated context. If you know you need this, you'll know — most domains don't.

### Template

```markdown
# [Sibling Domain] Session Boot Prompt

**Generated by:** [Source Domain] session on [DATE]
**For:** New [Sibling Domain] session. Delete this file once processed.

## 1. Identity
You are Claude, working with [USER] on [sibling domain description].

## 2. LIMO Architecture
This domain has its own LIMO core at `[Sibling]/limo-populated/core/`. Read AI_AGENTS_READ_THIS_FIRST.md to bootstrap.
The source domain ([Source]) is a sibling — you can read from it but not write to it.

## 3. Relevant Context from Source Domain
[People, data, active situations, key evidence — ONLY what's relevant to the sibling]

## 4. Immediate Priorities
1. [What the sibling session should do first]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

## Extended BRAIN_TRANSFER

The core framework specifies 3 sections for BRAIN_TRANSFER (Corrections Log, Communication Style,
Reasoning Patterns). Complex domains may need more. Here are additional sections that proved
useful in Finance/Legal:

- **Quick Reference Tables** — Derived values that took effort to compute (tax brackets, asset allocations, legal deadlines)
- **Domain Intelligence** — Pattern-level knowledge from multiple sessions
- **Analytical Frameworks** — How to approach problems in this domain
- **Key People Quick Ref** — Compact name/role/context table (supplements KEY_PEOPLE.md for fast loading)

Add these as numbered sections after the core 3 when the domain earns them through real usage.

## Provenance

These patterns were extracted from the Finance domain implementation (v2.0), which ran 10+
sessions and developed the most sophisticated handover and cross-domain protocols in the LIMO
ecosystem. They are preserved here as proven patterns that complex domains can adopt — not as
requirements that every domain must implement.
