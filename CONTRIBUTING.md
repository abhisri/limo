PRs welcome. Please keep changes:
- domain‑agnostic by default,
- additive (don’t break existing workflows),
- and easy to audit.

## Style
- Prefer templates over long prose.
- Put “how to use” instructions in prompts.
- Keep `core/` files minimal and stable.

## What’s helpful
- New domain packs under `domains/`
- Optional scripts under `scripts/` (hashing, manifesting, staleness checks)
- Improvements to invariants / never-again patterns
